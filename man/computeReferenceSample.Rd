\title{Compute Reference Sample Based on Covariance Norms}
\usage{
computeReferenceSample(data, markers, sampleCol = "sample_id", N = 2)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Data frame containing sample information.}

\item{markers}{Character vector of marker column names.}

\item{sampleCol}{Character; name of the sample ID column.}

\item{N}{Integer; number of top and bottom samples to return.}
}
\value{
A list containing the matrix of norms, average norms, and sample indices
for top, bottom, median, reference, and validation samples.
}
\description{
This function computes covariance matrices for each sample, then calculates
pairwise Frobenius norms between them to identify reference samples.
Returns the top, bottom, median, reference, and validation samples.
